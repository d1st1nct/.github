# Distinct Research

A group of cybersecurity professionals focused on building, sharing, and researching.  
We work together to create tools, develop projects, and write practical CTF solutions.  
We also maintain a team on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/teams/overview/2089), though our main focus is on independent research and tool development.
